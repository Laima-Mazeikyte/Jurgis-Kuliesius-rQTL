<h2>Study Design &amp; Rationale</h2>
<p>Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have repeatedly scanned the human genome for associations with thousands of protein levels. The approach has successfully identified numerous causal genetic links to disease by bridging the functional gap in post-GWAS analyses via mendelian randomization, colocalization and other statistical approaches.</p>

<details class="detailed-explanation">
<summary><span class="details-summary-text">Primer on Proteomic GWAS</span><svg class="details-chevron-icon" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M9 18l6-6-6-6"/></svg></summary>
<p>While GWAS has successfully identified genomic loci associated with numerous conditions like Alzheimer&#39;s disease, most identified variants lie in non-coding regions. This makes it difficult to determine the biological mechanism and the specific genes, tissues, or pathways, through which a specific genetic variant affects the disease phenotype.</p>
<p>To resolve this, the field has turned to proteomic GWAS, also known as protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTL) analysis. In this approach, instead of linking genetics to a disease, the individual abundances of thousands of proteins are treated as phenotypes of interest. These associations are categorized as either cis-pQTLs, where variants are located near or within the protein&#39;s own gene indicating direct regulation, or trans-pQTLs, where distant variants regulate the protein. Mapping cis protein-regulating genetic variants is inherently useful for modern tools like Mendelian Randomization, which can statistically predict whether a drug targeting a specific protein will effectively treat a disease based on genetic evidence.</p>

</details>


<p>However, by considering each multiplexed protein in isolation, the GWAS fails to shed light on the pathways through which these proteins are mediating their effects.</p>

      <section id="protein-ratios">
<h2>The Logic Behind Protein Ratios</h2>
<p>In this study, rather than analyzing protein abundances separately, we analyze ratios of protein pairs in a protein ratio-QTL (rQTL) framework. This approach is designed to increase the signal to noise ratio by canceling out any shared variance between protein pairs.</p>
<p>Suppose Protein A has a genetic signal but is buried in environmental noise, which can be either biological (e.g. inflammation) or technical. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>ProteinA abundance = Genetics A + Inflammation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Protein B has no genetic signal in that locus but is affected by the exact same noise, such as fluctuating similarly with inflammation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ProteinB abundance = Inflammation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we take the log ratio, we subtract the shared environment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A/B Ratio = ProteinA – ProteinB = Genetics A + Inflammation – Inflammation = Genetics A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result is a genetic signal, stripped of the biological noise that previously suppressed it.</p>

<details class="detailed-explanation">
<summary><span class="details-summary-text">Why does this work?</span><svg class="details-chevron-icon" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M9 18l6-6-6-6"/></svg></summary>
<p>Measurement &quot;noise&quot;, such as inflammation or sample handling, doesn&#39;t just add a fixed amount of protein but usually acts as a multiplier. If a sample is more concentrated or inflamed, it might double (×2) the levels of particular proteins in that sample.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Protein A abundance = Genetics A×Noise</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Protein abundances are measured on a Log2 scale. This is crucial because the log of a product is the sum of its parts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>log(Protein A abundance) = log(Genetics A×Noise) = log(Genetics A)+log(Noise)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;log of a ratio&quot; is the same as subtraction: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>log(A/B)=log(A)−log(B)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the noise is now an additive term, if noise is shared between two proteins, subtracting erases it completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>log(Protein A abundance)/log(Protein B abundance) = log(Genetics A×Noise)/log(Noise) = (Genetics+Noise)−(Noise) = Genetics A</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When comparing the association strength (p-value) of a protein ratio (rQTL) against the same genetic variant’s single-protein baseline (pQTL), results fall into three distinct scenarios:</p>
<h3>1. Signal Dilution (Both Decrease)</h3>
<p>The two proteins are biologically unrelated and share little non-genetic variance. By creating a ratio, the unique noise of the second protein is introduced without adding any corresponding genetic signal. This dilutes the genetic signal of the first protein with the noise of the second, and vice versa, reducing statistical power to detect either signal. </p>
<p>This represents the majority of random protein pairings.</p>
<h3>2. Asymmetric Gain (Mixed)</h3>
<p>The ratio improves the association strength for one protein while decreasing it for the other. The reference protein acts as a proxy for non-genetic variance, reducing the residual variance for the other protein measurement. While this signal cleaning effect improves the power to detect one of the genetic signals, the reverse correction fails due to the reverse signal containing its own unique noise that does not correlate with the reference protein.</p>
<p>Rather than a direct biological interaction between the variant and both proteins, this scenario is interpreted as noise correction. </p>
<h3>3. Symmetric Gain (Both Increase)</h3>
<p>The ratio rQTL association is significantly stronger than the single-protein pQTL associations for both components. This is highly indicative of a biological interaction or a shared biochemical pathway. Two mechanisms lead to this symmetric boost in power:</p>
<p><strong>Shared Noise Cancellation (Independent Signals):</strong>
Proteins rarely function in isolation. Instead, they fluctuate together in response to shared biological states, such as inflammation levels, cell counts, or metabolic processes. Therefore, even if the proteins are biologically distinct and regulated by different genes, they often share the same systemic variation. For example, if both Protein A and Protein B are regulated by the same immune pathway, their levels will rise and fall together across the population, masking the subtle effects of their specific genetic variants (cis-pQTLs). Once this shared biological background is removed, the genetic signals specific to either protein rise in significance.</p>
<p><strong>Opposing Genetic Effects:</strong>
In rarer cases, the genetic variant affects both proteins but in opposite directions — increasing Protein A while decreasing Protein B. Because the genetic effects have opposite signs, the composite signal becomes stronger than either protein shows on its own. This would point to a direct functional relationship, such as a substrate-product pair where the variant affects the enzyme converting one to the other.</p>

<p>This scatter plot confirms the opposing direction of the genetic effect as an important predictor of success for ratio analysis. Each dot represents a particular genome-wide significant genetic variant tested in a protein pair. The X-axis is the effect on Protein A and the Y-axis is the effect on Protein B. The color indicates the result: blue dots represent a gain in statistical signal for the rQTL (a stronger p-value), while red dots represent a loss or dilution of signal, when compared to the best pQTL in the ratio.</p>
<p>Significant rQTL (blue) cluster in the top-left and bottom-right &quot;opposite sign&quot; zones. Here, the genetic variant is linked with increasing one protein’s abundance while decreasing the other (e.g., Protein A goes up, Protein B goes down). As predicted in the Opposing Genetic Effects scenario above, when the genetics push the two proteins in opposite directions, the ratio amplifies this contrast, resulting in net signal gain.</p>

<h2>Ratios of the Microglial Proteome</h2>
<p>In this study, we compared rQTL results from cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma, revealing a fundamental difference in how Alzheimer&#39;s disease-associated microglia proteins are regulated in their native environment (CSF) versus the periphery (blood plasma). The two cohorts share similar sample sizes (1,888 for CSF vs. 2,150 for plasma), identical European ancestry, and the same multiplex proteomic technology (SomaScan 7k). Furthermore, every protein measurement was genetically validated to possess a cis pQTL within its respective tissue. Despite these consistencies, the CSF results (<em>CSF graph</em>) demonstrate a highly interconnected proteomic network that is absent in plasma (<em>Plasma graph</em>). </p>

<p>Of the 78 tested protein ratios in CSF, 30 (38%) showcase either symmetric or asymmetric gain in signal, indicating that in the central nervous system these proteins fluctuate in coordination with one another. Consequently, forming ratios in CSF frequently succeeds in removing shared biological &quot;noise” (i.e. common inflammatory states or microglial activation levels), thereby increasing the power to detect these variants compared to single-protein analyses.</p>
<p>In sharp contrast, performing the same analysis in blood plasma (Graph B) exhibits a near-total collapse of this network structure. The plasma analysis had a greater set of potential targets testing 105 ratios, compared to 78 in CSF, given a higher number of protein measurements possessing single protein cis-variants (15 vs 13). Despite 8 of these 15 measurements overlapping between the two tissues, the ratios failed to improve the QTL signal strength in all but 3 instances (3%). Notably, 2 of these overlapped with CSF results and the ratio between the two separate TREM2 assays was not tested due to the lack of a cis signal in the secondary measurement. While strong single-protein signals exist in isolation in blood plasma, they do not share the systematic variance with other microglia proteins required for a ratio to generate a p-gain.</p>
<p>This suggests that while most microglial proteins are detectable in plasma, they likely originate as cellular leakage or uncoupled debris rather than as part of a coordinated biological response. In CSF, the proteins often behave as a system, where Protein A serves as a valid proxy for the environmental noise affecting Protein B. In plasma, these same proteins appear to fluctuate independently, governed by clearance rates or peripheral noise rather than shared regulation and disease pathways. Therefore, constructing ratios in plasma predominantly introduces the unique noise of the second protein without subtracting any shared variance, diluting the original genetic signals rather than enhancing them.</p>

      <section id="section-3">
<h2>Case Study: TREM2 / TREM2 Signal in Blood Plasma</h2>
<p>We measured the protein TREM2 using two different probes (SomaScan aptamers) in the same cohort in plasma samples. As expected, the two protein abundance measurements were highly correlated (r = 0.81), indicating they were both detecting the same broad differences in TREM2 abundance. However, when we analyzed the ratio of these two measurements (<em>Probe 16300-4 / Probe 5635-66</em>), the genetic signal at the TREM2 locus became stronger than for either measurement alone.</p>
<p>Counterintuitively, taking the ratio of two measurements for the same protein acts as a powerful &quot;noise filter.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canceling Abundance:</strong> Both probes capture the total amount of protein driven by non-genetic factors either biological (inflammation or clearance rates) or technical (sampling handling variability). Forming a ratio of the two protein measurements removes this shared variation.</li>
<li><strong>Revealing Structure:</strong> What remains in the ratio is the difference between the two probes. This creates a detector for genetic variants that alter the protein&#39;s physical structure (epitopes) or isoform composition, affecting how well one probe binds the target compared to the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focusing on this difference, we fine-mapped the signal using SuSiE to two variants that affect which version of TREM2 is present, rather than just how much:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>R62H Mutation (Exon 2 Skipping):</strong> The ratio highlighted the R62H variant in TREM2 (rs143332484), a mutation <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11224616/">known to increase the skipping of Exon 2</a>. This suggests that one of the aptamers binds to the region encoded by Exon 2 (losing signal when it is skipped), while the other binds a region common to all isoforms. </li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Variant (rs188904277):</strong> A non-coding variant predicted to alter transcription factor binding (81% confidence via AlphaGenome), which could be regulating the specific expression of TREM2 isoforms.</li>
</ul>
